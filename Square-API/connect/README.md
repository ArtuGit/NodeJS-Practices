# Square OAuth Flow Example (Node.js)

This example demonstrates a bare-bones Node.js implementation of the OAuth flow for Square APIs. It serves a link that
directs merchants to the OAuth Permissions form and handles the result of the authorization, which is sent to your
application's Redirect URL (specified on the application dashboard).

## Getting started

### Step 1: Download dependencies

This application requires the Node.js Square SDK and Express, which you install via npm. Open your terminal in this
directory and type:

```
npm install
```

### Step 2: Get your credentials and set the redirect URL:

1. Open the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps).
1. Choose **Open** on the card for an application.
1. At the top of the page, set the dashboard mode to **Sandbox**.
1. Choose **OAuth** in the left navigation pane. The OAuth page is shown.
1. In the **Sandbox Redirect URL** box, enter the URL for the callback you will implement to complete the OAuth flow:
   `http://localhost:8000/sandbox_callback`

   This example uses localhost in the Square Sandbox. You can use HTTP for localhost but an actual web server
   implementation must use HTTPS.
1. In the **Sandbox Application ID** box, copy the application ID.
1. In the **Sandbox Application Secret** box, choose **Show**, and then copy the application secret.
1. Click **Save**.
1. In your project directory, create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`
1. In the newly created .env file, replace the `YOUR_SANDBOX_APPLICATION_ID` and `YOUR_SANDBOX_APPLICATION_SECRET`
   placeholders with the Sandbox application ID and Sandbox application secret, respectively.

   Note that OAuth Sandbox credentials begin with a sandbox prefix and that the base URL for calling Sandbox endpoints
   is https://connect.squareupsandbox.com. When you implement for production, you need production credentials and
   use https://connect.squareup.com as the base URL.

   **WARNING**: Never check your credentials/access_token into your version control system. We've added `.env` to
   the `.gitignore` file to help prevent uploading confidential information.

### Step 3: Running the example

1. Open the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps).

1. In the Sandbox Test Accounts section, find one test acount and choose Open.

1. Start the Node server, if it is not running:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

1. Open http://localhost:8000/sandbox_request_token to start.
